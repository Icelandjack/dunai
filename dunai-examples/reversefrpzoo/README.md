MSFs can be used to implement many forms of FRP, including classic and
arrowized. They also implemente Daniel Winograd-Cort's wormholes.

This directory is here to include examples, possibly with one cabal file,
of how MSFs can be used to implement different forms of FRP.

# MSFs vs varying

The two concepts in these libraries are isomorphic and, in principle, equally
expressive.

# MSFs vs Auto

Auto has more constructors, and includes serialization and de-serialization.
