This game uses components from different origins, and as such
has a complex licence.

Please, take into account that some of the resources used are only free for
non-commercial purposes. People have worked hard to create them, and we'd like
to honour their work by respecting their terms and ask you to do the same.

* Credits

Inspiration has been drawn from Antony Courtney and Henrik Nilsson's asteroids
game. This is mainly present in the definition of ObjectSF and in the main game
loop, which uses a structure similar to the one described in the paper ``The
Yampa Arcade''. Other than that, the code is our own (IP & HN).

Also, if you are using this for a course, or a talk, or something like that; it
would be great if you could let us know ( psxip1@nott.ac.uk or
nhn@cs.nott.ac.uk). Just to know how it has been useful. We have additional
resources that you may find useful for your talk, including videos of this game
running on different platforms, statistics/benchmarks, etc.
